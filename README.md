### Detailed DNS Resolution and Subsequent Steps

When a user types `https://www.google.com` in the browser and presses Enter, several steps occur to resolve the domain name and establish a secure connection:

1. **Browser Cache**: The browser checks its cache for the IP address of `www.google.com`.
2. **Operating System Cache**: If not found, the browser queries the OS cache.
3. **Router Cache**: If the IP is still not found, the query goes to the router's cache.
4. **ISP's DNS Server**: If the router doesn't have the IP, the request is sent to the ISP's DNS server.
5. **Recursive DNS Query**: The ISP's DNS server recursively queries other DNS servers until the authoritative DNS server for `google.com` is found.
6. **Authoritative DNS Server Response**: The authoritative DNS server responds with the IP address of `www.google.com`.
7. **TCP/IP Connection Establishment**: The browser establishes a TCP connection to the IP address on port 443.
8. **SSL/TLS Handshake**: The browser and server perform an SSL/TLS handshake for secure communication.
9. **Firewall Traversal**: The request passes through firewalls (e.g., ISP and local).
10. **Load Balancer**: The request reaches the load balancer, distributing it to an available web server.
11. **Web Server Processing**: The web server processes the request or forwards it to the application server.
12. **Application Server Processing**: The application server processes the request and may interact with the database.
13. **Response Back to Client**: The response is sent back through the same path to the client browser.

This comprehensive explanation provides a clear understanding of the process, from DNS resolution to receiving the response.
